Description: This package is intended to replace the functions qqnorm and
    qqplot from the stats package. It is also intended to replace the qq
    function from the qqman package. The package also includes a function
    to prune data for quantile-quantile plots. This can drastically reduce
    the running time for large samples, for 100 million samples, you can
    expect a factor 80X speedup.
